  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Operating System</td>
    <td>The software that controls the overall operation of a computer. It provides the means by which a user can store and retrieve files, provides the interface by which a user can request the execution of programs, and provides the environment necessary to execute the programs requested.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Job Queue</td>
    <td>A job queue is a data structure maintained by job scheduler software containing jobs to run.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Fifo</td>
    <td>First-in, first-out (abbreviated FIFO and pronounced “FI-foe”) fashion. That is, the objects are removed from the queue in the order in which they arrived</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Multiprogramming</td>
    <td>Multiprogramming is a rudimentary form of parallel processing in which several programs run at the same time on a uniprocessor system.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Application Software
</td>
    <td>Application software consists of the programs for performing tasks particular to the machine’s utilization. A machine used to maintain the inventory for a manufacturing company will contain different application software from that found on a machine used by an electrical engineer.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>System Software</td>
    <td>System software performs those tasks that are common to computer systems in general. In a sense, the system software provides the infrastructure that the application software requires, in much the same manner as a nation’s infrastructure (government, roads, utilities, financial institutions, etc.) provides the foundation on which its citizens rely for their individual lifestyles.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Utility Software</td>
    <td>Utility software consists of programs for performing activities that are fundamental to computer installations but not included in the operating system.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Graphical User Interface (GUI)</td>
    <td>Objects to be manipulated, such as files and programs, are represented pictorially on the display as icons. These systems allow users to issue commands by using one of several common input devices.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Shell</td>
    <td>Older user interfaces, called shells, communicated with users through textual messages using a keyboard and monitor screen.</td>
</tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Kernel</td>
    <td>The internal part of an operating system is called the kernel. An operating system’s kernel contains those software components that perform the very basic functions required by the computer installation.</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Device Driver</td>
    <td>A device driver is a special kind of software program that controls a specific hardware device attached to a computer.</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>File Manager</td>
    <td>The file manager maintains records of all the files stored in mass storage, including where each file is located, which users are allowed to access the various files, and which portions of mass storage are available for new files or extensions to existing files.</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Memory Manager</td>
    <td>Is charged with the task of coordinating the machine’s use of main memory.</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Virtual Memory</td>
    <td>Memory that appears to exist as main storage although most of it is supported by data held in secondary storage, transfer between the two being made automatically as required.</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Boot Strapping</td>
    <td>Performed by a computer each time it is turned on. It is this procedure that transfers the operating system from mass storage (where it is permanently stored) into main memory (which is essentially empty when the machine is first turned on).</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>ROM</td>
    <td>ROM (read-only memory) is a non-volatile memory type. This means it receives data and permanently writes it on a chip, and it lasts even after you turn off your computer.</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Deadlock</td>
    <td>The condition in which two or more processes are blocked from progressing because each is waiting for a resource that is allocated to another.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Spooling.</td>
    <td>Spooling is a process in which data is temporarily held to be used and executed by a device, program or the system.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Super User</td>
    <td>This person gains highly privileged access to the operating system by identifying him- or herself as the administrator (usually by name and password) during the login procedure.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Multi Factor Authentication</td>
    <td>Multi-factor authentication is an electronic authentication method in which a user is granted access to a website or application only after successfully presenting two or more pieces of evidence to an authentication mechanism.</td>
