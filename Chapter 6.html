  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Machine Language</td>
    <td>Machine language refers to the set of instructions that a computer processor can understand and execute directly. Machine language instructions are represented in binary code and are specific to the hardware architecture of a particular computer system.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Debugging</td>
    <td>Debugging is the process of finding and fixing errors or defects in a computer program. Debugging tools are used to identify the location and cause of the error, and then the code is modified to remove the error.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Assembler</td>
    <td>An assembler is a program that converts assembly language code into machine language code.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Assembly Language</td>
    <td>Assembly language is a low-level programming language that uses mnemonics to represent machine language instructions. Assembly language is specific to the hardware architecture of a particular computer system.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Translator
</td>
    <td>A translator is a program that converts source code written in one programming language to another programming language. A translator can be a compiler or an interpreter.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Compiler</td>
    <td>A compiler is a program that translates source code written in a high-level programming language into machine language code. The resulting code is then executed directly by the computer's processor.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Interpreter</td>
    <td>An interpreter is a program that translates and executes code one instruction at a time. Interpreters are commonly used for scripting languages and can be slower than compiled programs.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Cross-Platform Software </td>
    <td>Cross-platform software is software that can run on multiple operating systems or hardware platforms without modification.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Natural Language</td>
    <td>A natural language is a language that has evolved naturally over time, such as English, French, or Chinese. Natural languages are typically used for human communication.</td>
</tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Formal Language</td>
    <td>A formal language is a language that is designed for specific purposes, such as programming languages or mathematical notation. Formal languages have precise syntax and semantics.</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Machine Independence</td>
    <td>Machine independence refers to the ability of software to run on different computer systems without modification.</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>High-Level Programming Language</td>
    <td>A high-level programming language is a programming language that is designed to be easy to read and write. High-level programming languages abstract away many of the details of the hardware, making it easier to write complex programs.</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</td>
    <td>Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on objects, rather than actions or functions. Objects have attributes and methods that define their behavior.</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Scripting Language</td>
    <td>A scripting language is a programming language that is designed for quick prototyping or for automating tasks. Scripting languages are often interpreted and have simpler syntax than general-purpose programming languages.</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Integer:</td>
    <td>An integer is a whole number, either positive or negative.</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Float:</td>
    <td>A float is a decimal number.</td>
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>String:</td>
    <td>A string is a sequence of characters.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Primitive Data Type:</td>
    <td>A primitive data type is a basic data type that is built into a programming language. Examples of primitive data types include integers, floats, and booleans.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Data Structure:</td>
    <td>A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer program. Common data structures include arrays, linked lists, and trees.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>List:</td>
    <td>A list is a collection of values, ordered by index.</td>
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>Tuple:</td>
    <td>A tuple is a collection of values, ordered and immutable.</td>
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>Set:</td>
    <td>A set is a collection of unique values, unordered.</td>
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>Dictionary:</td>
    <td>A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs, unordered.</td>
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>Function</td>
    <td>A function is a block of code that performs a specific task. Functions can take inputs and return outputs.</td>
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>Local Variable</td>
    <td>A local variable is a variable that is defined within a function and is only accessible within that function.</td>
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>Global Variable</td>
    <td>A global variable is a variable that is defined outside of any function and can be accessed and modified by any part of the program.
</td>
  </tr>
 <tr>
    <td>Source Program</td>
    <td>A source program is an original code written by a programmer in a high-level programming language.</td>
  </tr>
<tr>
    <td>Object Program</td>
    <td>An object program is the machine language code generated by a compiler from a source program.</td>
